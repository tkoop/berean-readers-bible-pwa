<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now about the collection for the saints,
you are to do as I directed the churches of Galatia: On the first day
of every week, each of you should set aside a portion of his income,
saving it up, so that when I come no collections will be needed.
Then, on my arrival, I will send letters with those you recommend to
carry your gift to Jerusalem. And if it is advisable for me to go
also, they can travel with me. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">After I go through Macedonia, however, I
will come to you; for I will be going through Macedonia. Perhaps I
will stay with you awhile, or even spend the winter, so that you can
help me on my journey, wherever I go. For I do not want to see you
now only in passing; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord
permits. But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, because a great
door for effective work has opened to me, even though many oppose me.

<font face="Tahoma, serif">If Timothy comes, see to it that he has
nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is doing the work of the
Lord, just as I am. No one, then, should treat him with contempt.
Send him on his way in peace so that he can return to me, for I am
expecting him along with the brothers. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">You know that Stephanas and his household
were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves
to the service of the saints. Now I urge you, brothers, to submit to
