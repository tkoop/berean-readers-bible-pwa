<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Murder of Gedaliah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the seventh month, Ishmael son of
Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was a member of the royal family
and one of the king’s chief officers, came with ten men to Gedaliah
son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and they ate a meal together there. Then
Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and
struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the
sword, killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed to
govern the land. Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with
Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Chaldean soldiers who were there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the second day after the murder of
Gedaliah, when no one yet knew about it, eighty men who had shaved
off their beards, torn their garments, and cut themselves came from
Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria, carrying grain offerings and
frankincense for the house of the LORD. And Ishmael son of Nethaniah
went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Ishmael encountered the men, he said,
“Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.” And when they came into the
city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them
and threw them into a cistern. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But ten of the men among them said to
Ishmael, “Do not kill us, for we have hidden treasure in the
field—wheat, barley, oil, and honey!” So he refrained from
killing them with the others. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the cistern into which Ishmael had
thrown all the bodies of the men he had struck down along with
Gedaliah was a large one that King Asa had made for fear of Baasha
king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant
of the people of Mizpah—the daughters of the king along with all
the others who remained in Mizpah—over whom Nebuzaradan captain of
the guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of
Nethaniah took them captive and set off to cross over to the
Ammonites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Johanan son of Kareah and all the
commanders of the armies with him heard of all the crimes that
Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed, they took all their men and
went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. And they found him near the
great pool in Gibeon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When all the people with Ishmael saw
Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the army with him,
they rejoiced, and all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive at
Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah. But Ishmael son
of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and went to
the Ammonites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the
commanders of the armies with him took the whole remnant of the
people from Mizpah whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of
Nethaniah after Ishmael had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam: the
soldiers, women, children, and court officials he had brought back
from Gibeon. And they went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, near
Bethlehem, in order to proceed into Egypt to escape the Chaldeans.
For they were afraid of the Chaldeans because Ishmael son of
Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of
Babylon had appointed over the land. </font>
