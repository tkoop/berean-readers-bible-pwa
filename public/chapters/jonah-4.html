Compassion</b></font></p>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jonah, however, was greatly displeased,
and he became angry. So he prayed to the LORD, saying, “O LORD, is
this not what I said while I was still in my own country? This is why
I was so quick to flee toward Tarshish. I knew that You are a
gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger, abounding in loving
devotion—One who relents from sending disaster. And now, O LORD,
please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to
live.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the LORD replied, “Have you any
right to be angry?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jonah left the city and sat down east
of it, where he made himself a shelter and sat in its shade to see
what would happen to the city. So the LORD God appointed a vine, and
it grew up to provide shade over Jonah’s head to ease his
discomfort, and Jonah was greatly pleased with the plant. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When dawn came the next day, God appointed
a worm that attacked the plant so that it withered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As the sun was rising, God appointed a
scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah’s head so that
he grew faint and wished to die, saying, “It is better for me to
die than to live.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then God asked Jonah, “Have you any
right to be angry about the plant?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I do,” he replied. “I am angry
enough to die!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the LORD said, “You cared about the
plant, which you neither tended nor made grow. It sprang up in a
night and perished in a night. So should I not care about the great
city of Nineveh, which has more than 120,000 people who cannot tell
their right hand from their left, and many cattle as well?” </font>
