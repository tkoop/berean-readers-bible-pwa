“<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time Michael, the great prince
who stands watch over your people, will rise up. There will be a time
of distress, the likes of which will not have occurred from the
beginning of nations until that time. But at that time your
people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—will be
delivered. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">And many who sleep in the dust of the
earth will awake, some to everlasting life, but others to shame and
everlasting contempt. Then the wise will shine like the brightness of
the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness will shine like
the stars forever and ever. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I, Daniel, looked and saw two others
standing there, one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite
bank. One of them said to the man dressed in linen, who was above the
waters of the river, “How long until the fulfillment of these
wonders?” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the man dressed in linen, who was
above the waters of the river, raised his right hand and his left
hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by Him who lives forever,
saying, “It will be for a time, and times, and half a time. When
the power of the holy people has finally been shattered, all these
things will be completed.” </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Go on your way, Daniel,” he replied,
“for the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end.
Many will be purified, made spotless, and refined, but the wicked
will continue to act wickedly. None of the wicked will understand,
but the wise will understand. </font>
