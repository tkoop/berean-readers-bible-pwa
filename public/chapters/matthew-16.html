evening comes, you say, ‘The weather will be fair, for the sky is
red,’ and in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky
is red and overcast.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of
the sky, but not the signs of the times. A wicked and adulterous
generation demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign
of Jonah.”</font> Then He left them and went away. </font>

among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not understand?
Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how
many basketfuls you gathered? Or the seven loaves for the four
thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? How do you not
understand that I was not telling you about bread? But beware of the
leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</font> </font>
