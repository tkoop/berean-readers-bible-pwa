<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is what the LORD my God says:
“Pasture the flock marked for slaughter, whose buyers slaughter
them without remorse. Those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be the
LORD, for I am rich!’ Even their own shepherds have no compassion
on them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For I will no longer have compassion on
the people of the land, declares the LORD, but behold, I will cause

<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I pastured the flock marked for
slaughter, especially the afflicted of the flock. Then I took for
myself two staffs, calling one Favor and the other Union, and I
pastured the flock. And in one month I dismissed three shepherds. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">My soul grew impatient with the flock, and
their souls also detested me. Then I said, “I will no longer
shepherd you. Let the dying die, and the perishing perish; and let
those who remain devour one another’s flesh.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Next I took my staff called Favor and cut
it in two, revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations. It
was revoked on that day, and so the afflicted of the flock who were
watching me knew that it was the word of the LORD. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I told them, “If it seems right to
you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.” So they weighed out
my wages, thirty pieces of silver. </font>

devour the flesh of the choice sheep and tear off their hooves. </font>
