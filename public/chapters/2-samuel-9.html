<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David asked, “Is there anyone left
from the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for the sake of
Jonathan?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And there was a servant of Saul’s family
named Ziba. They summoned him to David, and the king inquired, “Are
you Ziba?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I am your servant,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king asked, “Is there anyone left
of Saul’s family to whom I can show the kindness of God?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Ziba answered, “There is still
Jonathan’s son, who is lame in both feet.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Where is he?” replied the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Ziba said, “Indeed, he is in
Lo-debar at the house of Machir son of Ammiel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So King David had him brought from the
house of Machir son of Ammiel in Lo-debar. And when Mephibosheth son
of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he fell facedown in
reverence. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David said, “Mephibosheth!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I am your servant,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do not be afraid,” said David, “for
surely I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan.
I will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul, and you
will always eat at my table.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Mephibosheth bowed down and said, “What
is your servant, that you should show regard for a dead dog like me?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king summoned Saul’s servant
Ziba and said to him, “I have given to your master’s grandson all
that belonged to Saul and to all his house. You and your sons and
servants are to work the ground for him and bring in the harvest, so
that your master’s grandson may have food to eat. But Mephibosheth,
your master’s grandson, is always to eat at my table.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty
servants. And Ziba said to the king, “Your servant will do all that
my lord the king has commanded.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table
like one of the king’s own sons. And Mephibosheth had a young son
named Mica, and all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants of
Mephibosheth. So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always
ate at the king’s table, and he was lame in both feet. </font>
