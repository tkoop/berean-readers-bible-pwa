<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus called the Twelve together and
gave them power and authority over all demons, and power to cure
diseases. And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to
heal the sick. <font color="#a80000">“Take nothing for the
journey,”</font> He told them, <font color="#a80000">“no staff,
no bag, no bread, no money, no second tunic. Whatever house you
enter, stay there until you leave that area. If anyone does not
welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that town,
as a testimony against them.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they set out and went from village to
village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Herod the tetrarch heard about all
that was happening, he was perplexed. For some were saying that John
had risen from the dead, others that Elijah had appeared, and still
others that a prophet of old had arisen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I beheaded John,” Herod said, “but
who is this man I hear such things about?” And he kept trying to
see Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the apostles returned and reported to
Jesus all that they had done. Taking them away privately, He withdrew
to a town called Bethsaida. But the crowds found out and followed
Him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and
He healed those who needed healing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As the day neared its end, the Twelve came
to Jesus and said, “Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the
surrounding villages and countryside for lodging and provisions. For
we are in a desolate place here.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“You
give them something to eat.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">We have only five loaves of bread and
two fish,” they answered, “unless we go and buy food for all
these people.” (There were about five thousand men.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He told His disciples, <font color="#a80000">“Have
them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”</font> They did so,
and everyone was seated. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Taking the five loaves and the two fish
and looking up to heaven, Jesus spoke a blessing and broke them. Then
He gave them to the disciples to set before the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They all ate and were satisfied, and the
disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left
over. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">One day as Jesus was praying in private
and the disciples were with Him, He questioned them: <font color="#a80000">“Who
do the crowds say I am?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They replied, “Some say John the
Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that a prophet of old
has arisen.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">But what about
you?”</font> Jesus asked. <font color="#a80000">“Who do you say I
am?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Peter answered, “The Christ of God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus strictly warned them not to tell
this to anyone. <font color="#a80000">“The Son of Man must suffer
many things,”</font> He said. <font color="#a80000">“He must be
rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and He must be
killed and on the third day be raised to life.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus said to all of them, <font color="#a80000">“If
anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his
cross daily and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his life will
lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">What does it profit
a man to gain the whole world, yet lose or forfeit his very self? If
anyone is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed
of him when He comes in His glory and in the glory of the Father and
of the holy angels. But I tell you truthfully, some who are standing
here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">About eight days after Jesus had said
these things, He took with Him Peter, John, and James, and went up on
a mountain to pray. And as He was praying, the appearance of His face
changed, and His clothes became radiantly white. Suddenly two men,
Moses and Elijah, began talking with Jesus. They appeared in glory
and spoke about His departure, which He was about to accomplish at
Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile Peter and his companions were
overcome by sleep, but when they awoke, they saw Jesus’ glory and
the two men standing with Him. As Moses and Elijah were leaving,
Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us
put up three shelters—one for You, one for Moses, and one for
Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While Peter was speaking, a cloud appeared
and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
And a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, whom I
have chosen. Listen to Him!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After the voice had spoken, only Jesus was
present with them. The disciples kept this to themselves, and in
those days they did not tell anyone what they had seen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The next day, when they came down from the
mountain, Jesus was met by a large crowd. Suddenly a man in the crowd
cried out, “Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only
child. A spirit keeps seizing him, and he screams abruptly. It throws
him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It keeps mauling
him and rarely departs from him. I begged Your disciples to drive it
out, but they were unable.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">O unbelieving and
perverse generation!”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“How
long must I remain with you and put up with you? Bring your son
here.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Even while the boy was approaching, the
demon slammed him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked
the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And they were all astonished at the
greatness of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While everyone was marveling at all that
Jesus was doing, He said to His disciples, <font color="#a80000">“Let
these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be
delivered into the hands of men.”</font> But they did not
understand this statement. It was veiled from them so that they could
not comprehend it, and they were afraid to ask Him about it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then an argument started among the
disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. But Jesus,
knowing the thoughts of their hearts, had a little child stand beside
Him. And He said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Whoever welcomes
this little child in My name welcomes Me, and whoever welcomes Me
welcomes the One who sent Me. For whoever is the least among all of
you, he is the greatest.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Master,” said John, “we saw someone
driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him, because he
does not accompany us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do not stop him,”</font>
Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“for whoever is not against
you is for you.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As the day of His ascension approached,
Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. He sent messengers on ahead,
who went into a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for
Him. But the people there refused to welcome Him, because He was
heading for Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the disciples James and John saw
this, they asked, “Lord, do You want us to call down fire from
heaven to consume them?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jesus turned and rebuked them. And He
and His disciples went on to another village. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As they were walking along the road,
someone said to Jesus, “I will follow You wherever You go.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Foxes

place to lay His head.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then He said to another man, <font color="#a80000">“Follow
Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The man replied, “Lord, first let me go

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jesus told him, <font color="#a80000">“Let
the dead bury their own dead. You, however, go and proclaim the
kingdom of God.”</font> </font>
