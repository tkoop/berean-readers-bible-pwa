<font><font face="Tahoma, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 17pt"><b>Galatians
5</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Freedom in Christ</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">It is for freedom that Christ has set us
free. Stand firm, then, and do not be encumbered once more by a yoke
of slavery. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Take notice: I, Paul, tell you that if you
let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at
all. Again I testify to every man who gets himself circumcised that
he is obligated to obey the whole law. You who are trying to be
justified by the law have been severed from Christ; you have fallen
away from grace. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But by faith we eagerly await through the
Spirit the hope of righteousness. For in Christ Jesus neither
circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. All that matters is
faith, expressed through love. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You were running so well. Who has
obstructed you from obeying the truth? Such persuasion does not come
from the One who calls you. A little leaven works through the whole
batch of dough. I am confident in the Lord that you will take no
other view. The one who is troubling you will bear the judgment,
whoever he may be. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now, brothers, if I am still preaching
circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the
offense of the cross has been abolished. As for those who are
agitating you, I wish they would proceed to emasculate themselves! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For you, brothers, were called to freedom;
but do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh. Rather,
serve one another in love. The entire law is fulfilled in a single
decree: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” But if you keep on
biting and devouring one another, watch out, or you will be consumed
by one another. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will
not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh craves what is
contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh.
They are opposed to each other, so that you do not do what you want.
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual
immorality, impurity, and debauchery; idolatry and sorcery; hatred,
discord, jealousy, and rage; rivalries, divisions, factions, and
envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before,
that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of
God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and
self-control. Against such things there is no law. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Those who belong to Christ Jesus have
crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Since we live by
the Spirit, let us walk in step with the Spirit. Let us not become
conceited, provoking and envying one another. </font>
