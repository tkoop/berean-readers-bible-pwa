<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Abram’s wife Sarai had borne him no
children, but she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar. So Sarai
said to Abram, “Look now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing
children. Please go to my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family
by her.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
So after he had lived in Canaan for ten years, his wife Sarai took
her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to Abram to be his wife.
And he slept with Hagar, and she conceived. But when Hagar realized
that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong
done to me be upon you! I delivered my servant into your arms, and
ever since she saw that she was pregnant, she has treated me with
contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Here,” said Abram, “your servant is
in your hands. Do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai treated
Hagar so harshly that she fled from her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the angel of the LORD found Hagar by a
spring of water in the desert—the spring along the road to Shur.
“Hagar, servant of Sarai,” he said, “where have you come from,
and where are you going?” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I am running away from my mistress

<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the angel of the LORD told her, “Return
to your mistress and submit to her authority.” Then the angel
added, “I will greatly multiply your offspring so that they will be
too numerous to count.” </font>
