<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Some time later, Naboth the Jezreelite
happened to own a vineyard in Jezreel next to the palace of Ahab king
of Samaria. So Ahab said to Naboth, “Give me your vineyard to use
as a vegetable garden, since it is next to my palace. I will give you
a better vineyard in its place—or if you prefer, I will give you
its value in silver.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Naboth replied, “The LORD forbid
that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Ahab went to his palace, sullen and
angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had told him, “I will not give
you the inheritance of my fathers.” He lay down on his bed, turned
his face away, and refused to eat. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Soon his wife Jezebel came in and asked,
“Why are you so sullen that you refuse to eat?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Ahab answered, “Because I spoke to
Naboth the Jezreelite and told him, ‘Give me your vineyard for
silver, or if you wish, I will give you another vineyard in its
place.’ And he replied, ‘I will not give you my vineyard!’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But his wife Jezebel said to him, “Do
you not reign over Israel? Get up, eat some food, and be cheerful,
for I will get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jezebel wrote letters in Ahab’s
name, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the elders and
nobles who lived with Naboth in his city. In the letters she wrote: </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Proclaim a fast and give Naboth a seat
of honor among the people. But seat two scoundrels opposite him and
have them testify, ‘You have cursed both God and the king!’ Then
take him out and stone him to death.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the elders and nobles who lived in
Naboth’s city did as Jezebel had instructed in the letters she had
written to them. They proclaimed a fast and gave Naboth a seat of
honor among the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the two scoundrels came in and sat
opposite Naboth, and these men testified against him before the
people, saying, “Naboth has cursed both God and the king!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they took him outside the city and
stoned him to death. Then they sent word to Jezebel: “Naboth has
been stoned to death.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been
stoned to death, she said to Ahab, “Get up and take possession of
the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, who refused to give it to you
for silver. For Naboth is no longer alive, but dead.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead,
he got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth
the Jezreelite. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah
the Tishbite, saying, “Get up and go down to meet Ahab king of
Israel, who is in Samaria. See, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, of
