<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now about food sacrificed to idols: We
know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds
up. The one who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he
ought to know. But the one who loves God is known by God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So about eating food sacrificed to idols:
We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world, and that there
is no God but one. For even if there are so-called gods, whether in
heaven or on earth (as there are many so-called gods and lords), yet
for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came
and for whom we exist. And there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ,
through whom all things came and through whom we exist. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But not everyone has this knowledge. Some
people are still so accustomed to idols that they eat such food as if
it were sacrificed to an idol. And since their conscience is weak, it
is defiled. But food does not bring us closer to God: We are no worse
if we do not eat, and no better if we do. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Be careful, however, that your freedom
does not become a stumbling block to the weak. For if someone with a
weak conscience sees you who are well informed eating in an idolâ€™s
temple, will he not be encouraged to eat food sacrificed to idols? So
this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your
knowledge. By sinning against your brothers in this way and wounding
their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother
to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him
to stumble. </font>
