<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now in the days that Ahaz son of Jotham,
the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, Rezin king of Aram marched up
to wage war against Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Pekah son of
Remaliah the king of Israel, but he could not overpower the city. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out
with your son Shear-jashub to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct
that feeds the upper pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field,
and say to him: Calm down and be quiet. Do not be afraid or
disheartened over these two smoldering stubs of firewood—over the
fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah. For Aram,
along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has plotted your ruin,
saying: ‘Let us invade Judah, terrorize it, and divide it among
ourselves. Then we can install the son of Tabeal over it as king.’
But this is what the Lord GOD says: </font>
