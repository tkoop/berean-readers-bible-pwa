<font face="Tahoma, serif">Continue in brotherly love. Do not neglect
to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have
entertained angels without knowing it. Remember those in prison as if
you were bound with them, and those who are mistreated as if you were
suffering with them. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Marriage should be honored by all and the
marriage bed kept undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral
and adulterers. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Keep your lives free from the love of
money and be content with what you have, for God has said: </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do not be carried away by all kinds of
strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by
grace and not by foods of no value to those devoted to them. We have
an altar from which those who serve at the tabernacle have no right
to eat. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Although the high priest brings the blood
of animals into the Holy Place as a sacrifice for sin, the bodies are
burned outside the camp. And so Jesus also suffered outside the city
gate, to sanctify the people by His own blood. Therefore let us go to
Him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace He bore. For here we do
not have a permanent city, but we are looking for the city that is to
come. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Through Jesus, therefore, let us
continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise, the fruit of lips
that confess His name. And do not neglect to do good and to share
with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Obey your leaders and submit to them, for
they watch over your souls as those who must give an account. To this
end, allow them to lead with joy and not with grief, for that would
be of no advantage to you. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now may the God of peace, who through the
blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord
Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with every good
thing to do His will. And may He accomplish in us what is pleasing in
His sight through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever.
Amen. </font>
