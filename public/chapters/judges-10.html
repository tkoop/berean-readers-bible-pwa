<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After the time of Abimelech, a man of
Issachar, Tola son of Puah, the son of Dodo, rose up to save Israel.
He lived in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Tola judged Israel twenty-three years, and
when he died, he was buried in Shamir. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Tola was followed by Jair the Gileadite,
who judged Israel twenty-two years. He had thirty sons who rode on
thirty donkeys. And they had thirty towns in the land of Gilead,
which to this day are called Havvoth-jair. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And again the Israelites did evil in the
sight of the LORD. They served the Baals, the Ashtoreths, the gods of
Aram, Sidon, and Moab, and the gods of the Ammonites and Philistines.
Thus they forsook the LORD and did not serve Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the anger of the LORD burned against
Israel, and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and
Ammonites, who that very year harassed and oppressed the Israelites,
and did so for eighteen years to all the Israelites on the other side
of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to
fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, and Israel
was in deep distress. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD,
saying, “We have sinned against You, for we have indeed forsaken
our God and served the Baals.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The LORD replied, “When the Egyptians,
Amorites, Ammonites, Philistines, Sidonians, Amalekites, and Maonites
oppressed you and you cried out to Me, did I not save you from their
hands? But you have forsaken Me and served other gods, so I will no
longer save you. Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them
save you in your time of trouble.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">We have sinned,” the Israelites said
to the LORD. “Deal with us as You see fit; but please deliver us
today!” So they put away the foreign gods from among them and
served the LORD, and He could no longer bear the misery of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the Ammonites were called to arms and
camped in Gilead, and the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah.
And the rulers of Gilead said to one another, “Whoever will launch
the attack against the Ammonites will be the head of all who live in
Gilead.” </font>
