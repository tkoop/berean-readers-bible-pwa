<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>No Other Gospel</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor
by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from
the dead— and all the brothers with me, </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">To the churches of Galatia: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Grace and peace to you from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for our sins to rescue us
from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and
Father, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I am amazed how quickly you are deserting
the One who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a
different gospel— which is not even a gospel. Evidently some people
are troubling you and trying to distort the gospel of Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But even if we or an angel from heaven
should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let
him be under a curse! As we have said before, so now I say again: If
anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received,
let him be under a curse! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Am I now seeking the approval of men, or
of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to
please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. For I certify to you,
brothers, that the gospel I preached was not devised by man. I did
not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received
it by revelation from Jesus Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For you have heard of my former way of
life in Judaism, how severely I persecuted the church of God and
tried to destroy it. I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my
contemporaries and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my
fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But when God, who set me apart from my
mother’s womb and called me by His grace, was pleased to reveal His
Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not
rush to consult with flesh and blood, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to
the apostles who came before me, but I went into Arabia and later
returned to Damascus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Only after three years did I go up to
Jerusalem to confer with Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days.
But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s
brother. I assure you before God that what I am writing to you is no
lie. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Later I went to the regions of Syria and
Cilicia. I was personally unknown, however, to the churches of Judea
that are in Christ. They only heard the account: “The man who
formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to
destroy.” And they glorified God because of me. </font>
