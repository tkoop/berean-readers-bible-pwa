<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Transfiguration</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After six days Jesus took with Him Peter,
James, and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain
by themselves. There He was transfigured before them. His face shone
like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before
them, talking with Jesus. Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good
for us to be here. If You wish, I will put up three shelters—one
for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While Peter was still speaking, a bright
cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is My
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to Him!” When the
disciples heard this, they fell facedown in terror. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus came over and touched them.
<font color="#a80000">“Get up,”</font> He said. <font color="#a80000">“Do
not be afraid.”</font> And when they looked up, they saw no one
except Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As they were coming down the mountain,
Jesus commanded them, <font color="#a80000">“Do not tell anyone
about this vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the
dead.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The disciples asked Him, “Why then do
the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Elijah
does indeed come, and he will restore all things. But I tell you that
Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have
done to him whatever they wished. In the same way, the Son of Man
will suffer at their hands.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the disciples understood that He was
speaking to them about John the Baptist. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When they came to the crowd, a man came up
to Jesus and knelt before Him. “Lord, have mercy on my son,” he
said. “He has seizures and is suffering terribly. He often falls
into the fire or into the water. I brought him to Your disciples, but
they could not heal him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">O unbelieving and
perverse generation!”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“How
long must I remain with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring
the boy here to Me.”</font> Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it
came out of the boy, and he was healed from that moment. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Afterward the disciples came to Jesus
privately and asked, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Because you have
so little faith,”</font> He answered. <font color="#a80000">“For
truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you
can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will
move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When they gathered together in Galilee,
Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“The Son of Man is about to
be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill Him, and on the
third day He will be raised to life.”</font> And the disciples were
deeply grieved. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After they had arrived in Capernaum, the
collectors of the two-drachma tax came to Peter and asked, “Does
your Teacher pay the two drachmas?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Yes,” he answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Peter entered the house, Jesus
preempted him. <font color="#a80000">“What do you think, Simon?”</font>
He asked. <font color="#a80000">“From whom do the kings of the
earth collect customs and taxes: from their own sons, or from
others?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">From others,” Peter answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the sons are
exempt,”</font> Jesus declared. <font color="#a80000">“But so
that we may not offend them, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take the
first fish you catch. When you open its mouth, you will find a
four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for My tax and yours.”</font>
