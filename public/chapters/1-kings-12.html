<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all
Israel had gone there to make him king. When Jeroboam son of Nebat
heard about this, he was still in Egypt where he had fled from King
Solomon and had been living ever since. So they sent for Jeroboam,
and he and the whole assembly of Israel came to Rehoboam and said,
“Your father put a heavy yoke on us. But now you should lighten the
burden of your father’s service and the heavy yoke he put on us,
and we will serve you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Rehoboam answered, “Go away for three
days and then return to me.” So the people departed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then King Rehoboam consulted with the
elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How
do you advise me to respond to these people?” he asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They replied, “If you will be a servant
to these people and serve them this day, and if you will respond by
speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the
elders; instead, he consulted the young men who had grown up with him
and served him. He asked them, “What message do you advise that we
send back to these people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten
the yoke your father put on us’?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The young men who had grown up with him
replied, “This is how you should answer these people who said to
you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you should make it
lighter.’ This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is
thicker than my father’s waist! Whereas my father burdened you with
a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you
with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After three days, Jeroboam and all the
people returned to Rehoboam, since the king had said, “Come back to
me on the third day.” And the king answered the people harshly. He
rejected the advice of the elders and spoke to them as the young men
had advised, saying, “Whereas my father made your yoke heavy, I
will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I
will scourge you with scorpions.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king did not listen to the people,
and indeed this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word
He had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When all Israel saw that the king had
refused to listen to them, they answered the king: </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">What portion do we have in David, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">and what inheritance in the son of Jesse? </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">To your tents, O Israel! </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Look now to your own house, O David!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the Israelites went home, but Rehoboam
still reigned over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then King Rehoboam sent out Adoram, who
was in charge of the forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to
death. And King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste and escaped to
Jerusalem. So to this day Israel has been in rebellion against the
house of David. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had
returned, they summoned him to the assembly and made him king over
all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah followed the house of David. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he
mobilized the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin—180,000
chosen warriors—to fight against the house of Israel and restore
the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the word of God came to Shemaiah the
man of God: “Tell Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, all the
house of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people that this is
what the LORD says: ‘You are not to go up and fight against your
brothers, the Israelites. Each of you must return home, for this word
is from Me.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they listened to the word of the LORD
and turned back according to the word of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill
country of Ephraim and lived there. And from there he went out and
built Penuel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the
kingdom might revert to the house of David. If these people go up to
offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, their hearts
will return to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah; then they will
kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After seeking advice, the king made two
golden calves and said to the people, “Going up to Jerusalem is too
much for you. Here, O Israel, are your gods, who brought you up out
of the land of Egypt.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">One calf he set up in Bethel, and the
other in Dan. And this thing became a sin; the people walked as far
as Dan to worship before one of the calves. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jeroboam also built shrines on the high
places and appointed from every class of people priests who were not
Levites. And Jeroboam ordained a feast on the fifteenth day of the
eighth month, like the feast that was in Judah, and he offered
sacrifices on the altar; he made this offering in Bethel to sacrifice
to the calves he had set up, and he installed priests in Bethel for
the high places he had set up. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the fifteenth day of the eighth month,
a month of his own choosing, Jeroboam offered sacrifices on the altar
he had set up in Bethel. So he ordained a feast for the Israelites,
offered sacrifices on the altar, and burned incense. </font>
