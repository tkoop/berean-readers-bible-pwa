<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If I speak in the tongues of men and of
angels, but have not love, I am only a ringing gong or a clanging
cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries
and all knowledge, and if I have absolute faith so as to move
mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess
to the poor and exult in the surrender of my body, but have not love,
I gain nothing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Love is patient, love is kind. It does not
envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not
self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no account of
wrongs. Love takes no pleasure in evil, but rejoices in the truth. It
bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all
things. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Love never fails. But where there are
prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be
restrained; where there is knowledge, it will be dismissed. For we
know in part and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the
partial passes away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When I was a child, I talked like a child,
I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man,
I set aside childish ways. Now we see but a dim reflection as in a
mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I
shall know fully, even as I am fully known. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And now these three remain: faith, hope,
and love; but the greatest of these is love. </font>
