<font face="Tahoma, serif">I speak the truth in Christ; I am not
lying, as confirmed by my conscience in the Holy Spirit. I have deep
sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I
myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my
brothers, my own flesh and blood, the people of Israel. Theirs is the
adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory and the covenants; theirs
the giving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises. Theirs
are the patriarchs, and from them proceeds the human descent of
Christ, who is God over all, forever worthy of praise! Amen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">It is not as though God’s word has
failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. Nor
because they are Abraham’s descendants are they all his children.
On the contrary, “Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.”
So it is not the children of the flesh who are God’s children, but
it is the children of the promise who are regarded as offspring. For
this is what the promise stated: “At the appointed time I will
return, and Sarah will have a son.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Not only that, but Rebecca’s children
were conceived by one man, our father Isaac. Yet before the twins
were born or had done anything good or bad, in order that God’s
plan of election might stand, not by works but by Him who calls, she
was told, “The older will serve the younger.” So it is written:
“Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">What then shall we say? Is God unjust?
Certainly not! For He says to Moses: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">and I will have compassion on whom I have
compassion.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So then, it does not depend on man’s
desire or effort, but on God’s mercy. For the Scripture says to
Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might
display My power in you, and that My name might be proclaimed in all
the earth.” Therefore God has mercy on whom He wants to have mercy,
and He hardens whom He wants to harden. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">One of you will say to me, “Then why
does God still find fault? For who can resist His will?” But who
are you, O man, to talk back to God? Shall what is formed say to Him
who formed it, “Why did You make me like this?” Does not the
potter have the right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel
for special occasions and another for common use? </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">What if God, intending to show His wrath
and make His power known, bore with great patience the vessels of His
wrath, prepared for destruction? What if He did this to make the
riches of His glory known to the vessels of His mercy, whom He
prepared in advance for glory— including us, whom He has called not
only from the Jews, but also from the Gentiles? As He says in Hosea: </font>
