<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I am the true
vine, and My Father is the keeper of the vineyard. He cuts off every
branch in Me that bears no fruit, and every branch that does bear
fruit, He prunes to make it even more fruitful. You are already clean
because of the word I have spoken to you. Remain in Me, and I will
remain in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself unless it
remains in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in
Me. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">I am the vine and
you are the branches. The one who remains in Me, and I in him, will
bear much fruit. For apart from Me you can do nothing. If anyone does
not remain in Me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and
withers. Such branches are gathered up, thrown into the fire, and
burned. If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, ask whatever
you wish, and it will be done for you. This is to My Father’s
glory, that you bear much fruit, proving yourselves to be My
disciples. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">As the Father has
loved Me, so have I loved you. Remain in My love. If you keep My
commandments, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My
Father’s commandments and remain in His love. I have told you these
things so that My joy may be in you and your joy may be complete. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">This is My
commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater
love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">You are My friends
if you do what I command you. No longer do I call you servants, for a
servant does not understand what his master is doing. But I have
called you friends, because everything I have learned from My Father
I have made known to you. You did not choose Me, but I chose you. And
I appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will remain—so
that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you. This
is My command to you: Love one another. </font></font>

you, understand that it hated Me first. If you were of the world, it
would love you as its own. Instead, the world hates you, because you
are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Remember the word
that I spoke to you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.’ If
they persecuted Me, they will persecute you as well; if they kept My
word, they will keep yours as well. But they will treat you like this
because of My name, since they do not know the One who sent Me. If I
had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin.
Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Whoever hates Me
hates My Father as well. If I had not done among them the works that
no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have
seen and hated both Me and My Father. But this is to fulfill what is
written in their Law: ‘They hated Me without reason.’ </font></font>

comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth
who proceeds from the Father—He will testify about Me. And you also
must testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning. </font></font>
