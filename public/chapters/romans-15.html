<font face="Tahoma, serif">We who are strong ought to bear with the
shortcomings of the weak and not to please ourselves. Each of us
should please his neighbor for his good, to build him up. For even
Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written: “The insults
of those who insult You have fallen on Me.” For everything that was
written in the past was written for our instruction, so that through
endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have
hope. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now may the God who gives endurance and
encouragement grant you harmony with one another in Christ Jesus, so
that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Accept one another, then, just as Christ
accepted you, in order to bring glory to God. For I tell you that
Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of God’s
truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs, so that the
Gentiles may glorify God for His mercy. As it is written: </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">I myself am convinced, my brothers, that
you yourselves are full of goodness, brimming with knowledge, and
able to instruct one another. However, I have written you a bold
reminder on some points, because of the grace God has given me to be
a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of
the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering
acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore I exult in Christ Jesus in my
service to God. I will not presume to speak of anything except what
Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to
obedience by word and deed, by the power of signs and wonders, and by
the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around
to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">In this way I have aspired to preach the

<font face="Tahoma, serif">But now that there are no further
opportunities for me in these regions, and since I have longed for
many years to visit you, I hope to see you on my way to Spain. And
after I have enjoyed your company for a while, you can equip me for
my journey. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem
to serve the saints there. For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to
make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem. They
were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the
Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings, they are obligated
to minister to them with material blessings. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">So after I have completed this service and
have safely delivered this bounty to them, I will set off to Spain by
way of you. I know that when I come to you, I will come in the
fullness of the blessing of Christ. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now I urge you, brothers, by our Lord
Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle
by praying to God for me. Pray that I may be delivered from the
unbelievers in Judea, and that my service in Jerusalem may be
acceptable to the saints there, so that by God’s will I may come to
you with joy and together with you be refreshed. </font>
