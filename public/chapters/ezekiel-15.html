<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, how does the wood of the vine surpass any
other branch among the trees in the forest? Can wood be taken from it
to make something useful? Or can one make from it a peg on which to
hang utensils? </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">No, it is cast into the fire for fuel. The
fire devours both ends, and the middle is charred. Can it be useful
for anything? Even when it was whole, it could not be made useful.
How much less can it ever be useful when the fire has consumed it and
charred it! </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
‘Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I
have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the people of
Jerusalem. And I will set My face against them. Though they may have
escaped the fire, yet another fire will consume them. And when I set
My face against them, you will know that I am the LORD. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Thus I will make the land desolate,
because they have acted unfaithfully,’ declares the Lord GOD.” </font>
