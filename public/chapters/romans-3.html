<font face="Tahoma, serif">But if our unrighteousness highlights the
righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust to
inflict His wrath on us? I am speaking in human terms. Certainly not!
In that case, how could God judge the world? However, if my falsehood
accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of His glory, why
am I still condemned as a sinner? Why not say, as some slanderously
claim that we say, “Let us do evil that good may result”? Their
condemnation is deserved! </font>

have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified
freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. </font>

faith in Jesus. </font>
