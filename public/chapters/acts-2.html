<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the day of Pentecost came, they were
all together in one place. Suddenly a sound like a mighty rushing
wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were
sitting. They saw tongues like flames of fire that separated and came
to rest on each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy
Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled
them. </font>

and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near
Cyrene; visitors from Rome, both Jews and converts to Judaism;
Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our

releasing Him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for
Him to be held in its clutches. </font>

has raised this Jesus to life, to which we are all witnesses. </font>
