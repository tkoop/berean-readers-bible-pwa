<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now a man of the house of Levi married a
daughter of Levi, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. When she
saw that he was a beautiful child, she hid him for three months. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But when she could no longer hide him, she
got him a papyrus basket and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she
placed the child in the basket and set it among the reeds along the
bank of the Nile. And his sister stood at a distance to see what
would happen to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Soon the daughter of Pharaoh went down to
bathe in the Nile, and her attendants were walking along the
riverbank. And when she saw the basket among the reeds, she sent her
maidservant to retrieve it. When she opened it, she saw the child,
and behold, the little boy was crying. So she had compassion on him
and said, “This is one of the Hebrew children.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s
daughter, “Shall I go and call one of the Hebrew women to nurse the
child for you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Go ahead,” Pharaoh’s daughter told
her. And the girl went and called the boy’s mother. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take
this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay your wages.” So the
woman took the boy and nursed him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the child had grown older, she
brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named
him Moses and explained, “I drew him out of the water.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">One day, after Moses had grown up, he went
out to his own people and observed their hard labor. He saw an
Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people. After looking this
way and that and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid
his body in the sand. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The next day Moses went out and saw two
Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you
attacking your companion?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the man replied, “Who made you ruler
and judge over us? Are you planning to kill me as you killed the
Egyptian?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Moses was afraid and thought, “This
thing I have done has surely become known.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Pharaoh heard about this matter, he
sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the
land of Midian, where he sat down beside a well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the priest of Midian had seven
daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water
their father’s flock. And when some shepherds came along and drove
them away, Moses rose up to help them and watered their flock. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the daughters returned to their
father Reuel, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early
today?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">An Egyptian rescued us from the
shepherds,” they replied. “He even drew water for us and watered
the flock.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">So where is he?” their father asked.
“Why did you leave the man behind? Invite him to have something to
eat.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he
gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage. And she gave birth
to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, “I have become a
foreigner in a foreign land.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After a long time, the king of Egypt died.
The Israelites groaned and cried out under their burden of slavery,
and their cry for deliverance from bondage ascended to God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So God heard their groaning, and He
remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God saw the
Israelites and took notice. </font>
