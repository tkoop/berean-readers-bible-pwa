<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, while Cain
was a tiller of the soil. So in the course of time, Cain brought some
of the fruit of the soil as an offering to the LORD, while Abel
brought the best portions of the firstborn of his flock. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD looked with favor on Abel and

became very angry, and his countenance fell. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Why are you angry,” said the LORD to
Cain, “and why has your countenance fallen? If you do what is
right, will you not be accepted? But if you refuse to do what is
right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires you, but you must
master it.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let
us go out to the field.” And while they were in the field, Cain

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">What have you done?” replied the
LORD. “The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the
ground. Now you are cursed and banished from the ground, which has
opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
When you till the ground, it will no longer yield its produce to you.
You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Cain said to the LORD, “My
punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold, this day You have
driven me from the face of the earth, and from Your face I will be

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Not so!” replied the LORD. “If
