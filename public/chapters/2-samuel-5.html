Samuel 5</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>David Anointed King of All Israel</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then all the tribes of Israel came to
David at Hebron and said, “Here we are, your own flesh and blood.
Even in times past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who
led Israel out and brought them back. And to you the LORD said, ‘You
will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be ruler over them.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So all the elders of Israel came to the
king at Hebron, where King David made with them a covenant before the
LORD. And they anointed him king over Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">David was thirty years old when he became
king, and he reigned forty years. In Hebron he reigned over Judah
seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three
years over all Israel and Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the king and his men marched to
Jerusalem against the Jebusites who inhabited the land. The Jebusites
said to David: “You will never get in here. Even the blind and lame
can repel you.” For they thought, “David cannot get in here.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Nevertheless, David captured the fortress
of Zion (that is, the City of David). On that day he said, “Whoever
attacks the Jebusites must use the water shaft to reach the lame and
blind who are despised by David.” That is why it is said, “The
blind and the lame will never enter the palace.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So David took up residence in the fortress
and called it the City of David. He built it up all the way around,
from the supporting terraces inward. And David became greater and
greater, for the LORD God of Hosts was with him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to
David, along with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons, and they
built a palace for David. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And David realized that the LORD had
established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for
the sake of His people Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After he had arrived from Hebron, David
took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, and more sons and
daughters were born to him. These are the names of the children born
to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, Ibhar,
Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the Philistines heard that David had
been anointed king over Israel, they all went in search of him; but
David learned of this and went down to the stronghold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the Philistines had come and spread
out in the Valley of Rephaim. So David inquired of the LORD, “Should
I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Go,” replied the LORD, “for I will
surely deliver the Philistines into your hand.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So David went to Baal-perazim, where he
defeated the Philistines and said, “Like a bursting flood, the LORD
has burst out against my enemies before me.” So he called that
place Baal-perazim. There the Philistines abandoned their idols, and
David and his men carried them away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Once again the Philistines came up and
spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. So David inquired of the LORD,
who answered, “Do not march straight up, but circle around behind
them and attack them in front of the balsam trees. As soon as you
hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move
quickly, because this will mean that the LORD has marched out before
you to strike the camp of the Philistines.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So David did as the LORD had commanded
him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to
Gezer. </font>
