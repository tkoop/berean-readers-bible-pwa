<font face="Tahoma, serif">That which was from the beginning, which
we have heard, which we have seen with our own eyes, which we have
gazed upon and touched with our own handsâ€”this is the Word of life.
And this is the life that was revealed; we have seen it and testified
to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life that was with the
Father and was revealed to us. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">We proclaim to you what we have seen and
heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And this
fellowship of ours is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.
We write these things so that our joy may be complete. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And this is the message we have heard from
Him and announce to you: God is light, and in Him there is no
darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with Him yet walk in
the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. But if we walk in
the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another,
and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">If we say we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is
faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make Him out to be
a liar, and His word is not in us. </font>
