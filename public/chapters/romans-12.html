<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore I urge you, brothers, on account
of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and
pleasing to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. Do not
be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of
your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what is the
good, pleasing, and perfect will of God. </font>

one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but
think of yourself with sober judgment, according to the measure of

members, and not all members have the same function, so in Christ we
who are many are one body, and each member belongs to one another. </font>

it is giving, let him give generously; if it is leading, let him lead
with diligence; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully. </font>
