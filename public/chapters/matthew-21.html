<font face="Tahoma, serif">As they approached Jerusalem and came to
Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent out two disciples,
saying to them, <font color="#a80000">“Go into the village ahead of
you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt
beside her. Untie them and bring them to Me. If anyone questions you,
tell him that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.”</font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus entered the temple courts and
drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the
tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.

house will be called a house of prayer.’ But you are making it ‘a

<font face="Tahoma, serif">The blind and the lame came to Him at the

<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the morning, as Jesus was returning to
the city, He was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, He went up to
it but found nothing on it except leaves. <font color="#a80000">“May
you never bear fruit again!”</font> He said. And immediately the
tree withered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the disciples saw this, they marveled

<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Truly I tell
you,”</font> Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“if you have
faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the fig
tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and
thrown into the sea,’ it will happen. If you believe, you will
receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”</font> </font>

you one question,”</font> Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“and

things. What was the source of John’s baptism? Was it from heaven
or from men?”</font> </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">They deliberated among themselves and
said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why then did
you not believe him?’ But if we say, ‘From men,’ we are afraid
of the people, for they all regard John as a prophet.” So they
answered, “We do not know.” </font>
