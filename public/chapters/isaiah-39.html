<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Hezekiah Shows His Treasures</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time Merodach-baladan son of
Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he
had heard about Hezekiah’s illness and recovery. And Hezekiah
welcomed the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his treasure
house—the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, as
well as his entire armory—all that was found in his storehouses.
There was nothing in his palace or in all his dominion that Hezekiah
did not show them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the prophet Isaiah went to King
Hezekiah and asked, “Where did those men come from, and what did
they say to you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">They came to me from a distant land,”
Hezekiah replied, “from Babylon.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">What have they seen in your palace?”
Isaiah asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">They have seen everything in my
palace,” answered Hezekiah. “There is nothing among my treasures
that I did not show them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the
word of the LORD of Hosts: The time will surely come when everything
in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this
day will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the
LORD. And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood, will be
taken away to be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word
of the LORD that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “At
least there will be peace and security in my lifetime.” </font>
