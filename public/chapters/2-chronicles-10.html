<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all
Israel had gone there to make him king. When Jeroboam son of Nebat
heard about this, he returned from Egypt, where he had fled from King
Solomon. So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel came to
Rehoboam and said, “Your father put a heavy yoke on us. But now you
should lighten the burden of your father’s service and the heavy
yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Rehoboam answered, “Come back to me in
three days.” So the people departed. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then King Rehoboam consulted with the
elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How
do you advise me to respond to these people?” he asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They replied, “If you will be kind to
these people and please them by speaking kind words to them, they
will be your servants forever.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the
elders; instead, he consulted the young men who had grown up with him
and served him. He asked them, “What message do you advise that we
send back to these people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten
the yoke your father put on us’?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The young men who had grown up with him
replied, “This is how you should answer these people who said to
you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you should make it
lighter.’ This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is
thicker than my father’s waist! Whereas my father burdened you with
a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you
with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”

<font face="Tahoma, serif">After three days, Jeroboam and all the
people returned to Rehoboam, since the king had said, “Come back to
me on the third day.” And the king answered them harshly. King
Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders and spoke to them as the
young men had advised, saying, “Whereas my father made your yoke
heavy, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with
whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king did not listen to the people,
and indeed this turn of events was from God, in order that the LORD
might fulfill the word that He had spoken through Ahijah the
Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then King Rehoboam sent out Hadoram, who

Jerusalem. So to this day Israel has been in rebellion against the
