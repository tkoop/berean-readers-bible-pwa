3</b></font></font></font></p>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the
heavenly calling, set your focus on Jesus, the apostle and high
priest whom we confess. He was faithful to the One who appointed Him,
just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For Jesus has been counted worthy of
greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater
honor than the house itself. And every house is built by someone, but
God is the builder of everything. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Moses was faithful as a servant in all
God’s house, testifying to what would be spoken later. But Christ
is faithful as the Son over God’s house. And we are His house, if
we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope of which we boast. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I swore on oath in My anger, </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">See to it, brothers, that none of you has
a wicked heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God. But
exhort one another daily, as long as it is called today, so that none
of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">We have come to share in Christ if we hold
firmly to the end the assurance we had at first. As it has been said:

<font face="Tahoma, serif">For who were the ones who heard and
rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? And with
whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned,
whose bodies fell in the wilderness? And to whom did He swear that
they would never enter His rest? Was it not to those who disobeyed?
So we see that it was because of their unbelief that they were unable
to enter. </font>
