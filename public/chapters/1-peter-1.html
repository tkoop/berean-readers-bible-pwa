<font face="Tahoma, serif">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ! By His great mercy He has given us new birth into a
living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
and into an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and
unfading, reserved in heaven for you, who through faith are shielded
by God’s power for the salvation that is ready to be revealed in
the last time. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">In this you greatly rejoice, though now
for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in various trials
so that the proven character of your faith—more precious than gold,
which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise,
glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. </font>

Be sober-minded. Set your hope fully on the grace to be given you at
the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient children, do not conform
to the passions of your former ignorance. But just as He who called
you is holy, so be holy in all you do, for it is written: “Be holy,
because I am holy.” </font>

your stay as foreigners. For you know that it was not with perishable
things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty
way of life you inherited from your forefathers, but with the
precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or spot. He was
known before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in the
