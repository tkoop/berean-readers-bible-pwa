<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab,
and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and not
a gap was left—though to that time I had not yet installed the
doors in the gates— Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message:
“Come, let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of
Ono.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But they were planning to harm me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I
am doing a great work and cannot come down. Why should the work stop
while I leave it to go down to you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Four times they sent me the same message,
and each time I gave the same reply. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The fifth time, Sanballat sent me this
same message by his young servant, who had in his hand an unsealed
letter that read: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">It is reported among the nations—and
Geshem agrees—that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and
this is why you are building the wall. According to these reports,
you are to become their king, and you have even appointed prophets in
Jerusalem to proclaim on your behalf: ‘There is a king in Judah.’
Soon these rumors will reach the ears of the king. So come, let us
confer together.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I sent him this reply: “There is
nothing to these rumors you are spreading; you are inventing them in
your own mind.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For they were all trying to frighten us,
saying, “Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will
never be finished.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But now, my God, strengthen my hands. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Later, I went to the house of Shemaiah son
of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was confined to his house. He
said: </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">inside the temple. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Let us shut the temple doors </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But I replied, “Should a man like me run

will not go!” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">I realized that God had not sent him, but
that he had uttered this prophecy against me because Tobiah and
Sanballat had hired him. He had been hired to intimidate me so that I
would sin by doing as he suggested, so they could give me a bad name
in order to discredit me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">O my God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat
for what they have done, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the

<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the wall was completed in fifty-two
days, on the twenty-fifth of Elul. When all our enemies heard about
this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and disheartened, for
they realized that this task had been accomplished by our God. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Also in those days, the nobles of Judah
sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came back to
them. For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, since he was a
son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had
married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moreover, these nobles kept reporting to
me Tobiah’s good deeds, and they relayed my words to him. And
Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me. </font>
