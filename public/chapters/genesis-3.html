<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the serpent was more crafty than any
beast of the field that the LORD God had made. And he said to the
woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in
the garden?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The woman answered the serpent, “We may
eat the fruit of the trees of the garden, but about the fruit of the
tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You must not eat
of it or touch it, or you will die.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">You will not surely die,” the serpent
told her. “For God knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes
will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the woman saw that the tree was good
for food and pleasing to the eyes, and that it was desirable for
obtaining wisdom, she took the fruit and ate it. She also gave some
to her husband who was with her, and he ate it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the eyes of both of them were opened,
and they knew that they were naked; so they sewed together fig leaves
and made coverings for themselves. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the man and his wife heard the voice
of the LORD God walking in the garden in the breeze of the day, and
they hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees
of the garden. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the LORD God called out to the man,
“Where are you?” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I heard Your voice in the garden,” he
replied, “and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.”

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Who told you that you were naked?”
asked the LORD God. “Have you eaten from the tree of which I
commanded you not to eat?” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the man answered, “The woman whom
You gave me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What
