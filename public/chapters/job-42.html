<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">My ears had heard of You, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">but now my eyes have seen You. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore I retract my words, </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After the LORD had spoken these words to
Job, He said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against
you and your two friends. For you have not spoken about Me
accurately, as My servant Job has. So now, take seven bulls and seven
rams, go to My servant Job, and sacrifice a burnt offering for
yourselves. Then My servant Job will pray for you, for I will accept
his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. For you
have not spoken accurately about Me, as My servant Job has.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the
Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD had told
them; and the LORD accepted Job’s request. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After Job had prayed for his friends, the
LORD restored his prosperity and doubled his former possessions. All
his brothers and sisters and prior acquaintances came and dined with
him in his house. They consoled him and comforted him over all the
adversity that the LORD had brought upon him. And each one gave him a
piece of silver and a gold ring. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the LORD blessed Job’s latter days
more than his first. He owned 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke
of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. And he also had seven sons and
three daughters. He named his first daughter Jemimah, his second
Keziah, and his third Keren-happuch. No women as beautiful as Job’s
daughters could be found in all the land, and their father granted
them an inheritance among their brothers. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After this, Job lived 140 years and saw
his children and their children to the fourth generation. And so Job
died, old and full of years. </font>
