<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So when we could bear it no longer, we
were willing to be left on our own in Athens. We sent Timothy, our
brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, to
strengthen and encourage you in your faith, so that none of you would
be shaken by these trials. For you know that we are destined for
this. Indeed, when we were with you, we kept warning you that we
would suffer persecution; and as you know, it has come to pass. For
this reason, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to find out about
your faith, for fear that the tempter had somehow tempted you and
caused our labor to be in vain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But just now, Timothy has returned from
his visit with the good news about your faith, your love, and the
fond memories you have preserved, longing to see us just as we long
to see you. For this reason, brothers, in all our distress and
persecution, we have been reassured about you, because of your faith.
For now we can go on living, as long as you are standing firm in the
Lord. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">How can we adequately thank God for you in
return for our great joy over you in His presence? Night and day we
pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face and supply what
is lacking from your faith. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now may our God and Father Himself, and
our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you. And may the Lord cause you to
increase and overflow with love for one another and for everyone
else, just as our love for you overflows, so that He may establish
your hearts in blamelessness and holiness before our God and Father
at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints. Amen. </font>
