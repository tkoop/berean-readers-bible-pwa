<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Death and Burial of Sarah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Sarah lived to be 127 years old. She
died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and
Abraham went out to mourn and to weep for her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Abraham got up from beside his dead
wife and said to the Hittites, “I am a foreigner and an outsider
among you. Give me a burial site among you so that I can bury my
dead.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Hittites replied to Abraham, “Listen
to us, sir. You are God’s chosen one among us. Bury your dead in
the finest of our tombs. None of us will withhold his tomb for
burying your dead.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Abraham rose and bowed down before
the people of the land, the Hittites. “If you are willing for me to
bury my dead,” he said to them, “listen to me, and approach
Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf to sell me the cave of Machpelah
that belongs to him; it is at the end of his field. Let him sell it
to me in your presence for full price, so that I may have a burial
site.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of
Heth. So in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate
of his city, Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham, “No, my lord.
Listen to me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is
in it. I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your
dead.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Again Abraham bowed down before the people
of the land and said to Ephron in their presence, “If you will
please listen to me, I will pay you the price of the field. Accept it
from me, so that I may bury my dead there.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Ephron answered Abraham, “Listen to me,
my lord. The land is worth four hundred shekels of silver, but what
is that between you and me? Bury your dead.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Abraham agreed to Ephron’s terms and
weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the
Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the standard
of the merchants. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Ephron’s field at Machpelah near
Mamre, the cave that was in it, and all the trees within the
boundaries of the field were deeded over to Abraham’s possession in
the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his
city. After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the
field at Machpelah near Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of
Canaan. So the field and its cave were deeded by the Hittites to
Abraham as a burial site. </font>
