<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived
in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim,
he attacked Israel and captured some prisoners. So Israel made a vow
to the LORD: “If You will deliver this people into our hands, we
will devote their cities to destruction.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD heard Israel’s plea and
delivered up the Canaanites. Israel devoted them and their cities to
destruction; so they named the place Hormah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then they set out from Mount Hor along the
route to the Red Sea, in order to bypass the land of Edom. But the
people grew impatient on the journey and spoke against God and
against Moses: “Why have you led us up out of Egypt to die in the
wilderness? There is no bread or water, and we detest this wretched
food!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the LORD sent venomous snakes among the
people, and many of the Israelites were bitten and died. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the people came to Moses and said,
“We have sinned by speaking against the LORD and against you.
Intercede with the LORD so He will take the snakes away from us.”
So Moses interceded for the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a
fiery serpent and mount it on a pole. When anyone who is bitten looks
at it, he will live.” So Moses made a bronze snake and mounted it
on a pole. If anyone who was bitten looked at the bronze snake, he
would live. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the Israelites set out and camped at
Oboth. They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim in the
wilderness opposite Moab to the east. From there they set out and
camped in the Valley of Zered. From there they moved on and camped on
the other side of the Arnon, in the wilderness that extends into the
Amorite territory. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king
of the Amorites, saying, “Let us pass through your land. We will
not cut through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well.
We will stay on the King’s Highway until we have passed through
your territory.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Sihon would not let Israel pass
through his territory. Instead, he gathered his whole army and went
out to confront Israel in the wilderness. When he came to Jahaz, he
fought against Israel. And Israel put him to the sword and took
possession of his land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok—but only up to
the border of the Ammonites, because it was fortified. </font>
