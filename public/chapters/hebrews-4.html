<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore, while the promise of entering
His rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be deemed
to have fallen short of it. For we also received the good news just
as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them,
since they did not share the faith of those who comprehended it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now we who have believed enter that rest.
As for the others, it is just as God has said: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I swore on oath in My anger, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
‘<font face="Tahoma, serif">They shall never enter My rest.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font face="Tahoma, serif"> </font></font><font face="Tahoma, serif">”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And yet His works have been finished since
the foundation of the world. For somewhere He has spoken about the
seventh day in this manner: “And on the seventh day God rested from
all His works.” And again, as He says in the passage above: “They
shall never enter My rest.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Since, then, it remains for some to enter
His rest, and since those who formerly heard the good news did not
enter because of their disobedience, God again designated a certain
day as “Today,” when a long time later He spoke through David as
was just stated: “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your
hearts.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For if Joshua had given them rest, God
would not have spoken later about another day. There remains, then, a
Sabbath rest for the people of God. For whoever enters God’s rest
also rests from his own work, just as God did from His. Let us,
therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will
fall by following the same pattern of disobedience. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For the word of God is living and active.
Sharper than any double-edged sword, it pierces even to dividing soul
and spirit, joints and marrow. It judges the thoughts and intentions
of the heart. Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight;
everything is uncovered and exposed before the eyes of Him to whom we
must give account. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore, since we have a great high
priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let
us hold firmly to what we profess. For we do not have a high priest
who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who
was tempted in every way that we are, yet was without sin. Let us
then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may
receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. </font>
