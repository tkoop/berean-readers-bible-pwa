<font face="Tahoma, serif">In those days the crowd once again became
very large, and they had nothing to eat. Jesus called the disciples
to Him and said, <font color="#a80000">“I have compassion for this
crowd, because they have already been with Me three days and have
nothing to eat. If I send them home hungry, they will faint along the
way. For some of them have come a great distance.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">His disciples replied, “Where in this
desolate place could anyone find enough bread to feed all these
people?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">How many loaves
do you have?”</font> Jesus asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Seven,” they replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And He instructed the crowd to sit down on
the ground. Then He took the seven loaves, gave thanks and broke
them, and gave them to His disciples to set before the people. And
they distributed them to the crowd. They also had a few small fish,
and Jesus blessed them and ordered that these be set before them as
well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The people ate and were satisfied, and the
disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left
over. And about four thousand men were present. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As soon as Jesus had dismissed the crowd,
He got into the boat with His disciples and went to the district of
Dalmanutha. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the Pharisees came and began to argue
with Jesus, testing Him by demanding from Him a sign from heaven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus sighed deeply in His spirit and
said, <font color="#a80000">“Why does this generation demand a
sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”</font>
And He left them, got back into the boat, and crossed to the other
side. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the disciples had forgotten to take
bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat. <font color="#a80000">“Watch
out!”</font> He cautioned them. <font color="#a80000">“Beware of
the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they began to discuss with one another
the fact that they had no bread. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Aware of their conversation, Jesus asked
them, <font color="#a80000">“Why are you debating about having no
bread? Do you still not see or understand? Do you have such hard
hearts? ‘Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not
hear?’ And do you not remember? When I broke the five loaves for
the five thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you
collect?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Twelve,” they answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when I broke
the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken
pieces did you collect?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Seven,” they said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then He asked them, <font color="#a80000">“Do
you still not understand?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When they arrived at Bethsaida, some
people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him. So He took
the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. Then He
spit on the man’s eyes and placed His hands on him. <font color="#a80000">“Can
you see anything?”</font> He asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The man looked up and said, “I can see
the people, but they look like trees walking around.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Once again Jesus placed His hands on the
man’s eyes, and when he opened them his sight was restored, and he
could see everything clearly. Jesus sent him home and said, <font color="#a80000">“Do
not go back into the village.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus and His disciples went on to
the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way, He questioned His
disciples: <font color="#a80000">“Who do people say I am?”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They replied, “Some say John the
Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">But what about
you?”</font> Jesus asked. <font color="#a80000">“Who do you say I
am?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Peter answered, “You are the Christ.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Jesus warned them not to tell anyone
about Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then He began to teach them that the Son
of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief
priests, and scribes, and that He must be killed and after three days
rise again. He spoke this message quite frankly, and Peter took Him
aside and began to rebuke Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jesus, turning and looking at His
disciples, rebuked Peter and said, <font color="#a80000">“Get
behind Me, Satan! For you do not have in mind the things of God, but
the things of men.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus called the crowd to Him along
with His disciples, and He told them, <font color="#a80000">“If
anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his
cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it,
but whoever loses his life for My sake and for the gospel will save
it.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">What does it profit
a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? Or what can a
man give in exchange for his soul? If anyone is ashamed of Me and My
words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will
also be ashamed of him when He comes in His Father’s glory with the
holy angels.” </font></font>
