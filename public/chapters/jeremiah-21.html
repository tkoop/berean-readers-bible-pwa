<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is the word that came to Jeremiah
from the LORD when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malchijah
and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. They said, “Please
inquire of the LORD on our behalf, since Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon is waging war against us. Perhaps the LORD will perform for
us something like all His past wonders, so that Nebuchadnezzar will
withdraw from us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jeremiah answered, “You are to tell
Zedekiah that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I
will turn against you the weapons of war in your hands, with which
you are fighting the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who besiege
you outside the wall, and I will assemble their forces in the center
of this city. And I Myself will fight against you with an
outstretched hand and a mighty arm, with anger, fury, and great
wrath. I will strike down the residents of this city, both man and
beast. They will die in a terrible plague.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
‘<font face="Tahoma, serif">After that,’ declares the LORD, ‘I
will hand over Zedekiah king of Judah, his officers, and the people
in this city who survive the plague and sword and famine, to
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who seek their
lives. He will put them to the sword; he will not spare them or show
pity or compassion.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Furthermore, you are to tell this people
that this is what the LORD says: ‘Behold, I set before you the way
of life and the way of death. Whoever stays in this city will die by
sword and famine and plague, but whoever goes out and surrenders to
the Chaldeans who besiege you will live; he will retain his life like
a spoil of war. For I have set My face against this city to bring
disaster and not good, declares the LORD. It will be delivered into
the hand of the king of Babylon, who will destroy it with fire.’ </font>

Judah to hear the word of the LORD. O house of David, this is what
the LORD says: </font>
