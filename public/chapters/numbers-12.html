<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Moses was a very humble man, more so

<font face="Tahoma, serif">he is faithful in all My house. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Why then were you unafraid to speak
against My servant Moses?” So the anger of the LORD burned against
them, and He departed. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">As the cloud lifted from above the Tent,
suddenly Miriam became leprous, white as snow. Aaron turned toward
her, saw that she was leprous, and said to Moses, “My lord, please
do not hold against us this sin we have so foolishly committed.
Please do not let her be like a stillborn infant whose flesh is half
